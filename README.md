# crater-defect-formation
A mathematical model for crater defect formation in a drying paint layer presented by [Evans et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci., 2000](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021979700968772). The craters are created due to surface-tension-gradient-driven flow as a result of a preexisting layer of surfactant on the paint. The equations are discretized using the Finite Differences Method (FDM) and integrated in time using the implicit Euler method.
