# crater-defect-formation
A mathematical model for crater defect formation in a drying paint layer presented by Evans et al., J. Colloid Interface Sci., 2000 (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0021979700968772). The equations are discretized using the Finite Differences Method (FDM) and integrated in time using the implicit Euler method.
